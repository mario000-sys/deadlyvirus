Here's how you can compile and run a C++ file:

**Compiling**

1. Open the terminal in your operating system.

2. Navigate to the directory where your C++ source code is located using the `cd` command (e.g., `cd /path/to/your/directory`).

3. Use the `g++` compiler to compile your C++ file into an executable file:
```
g++ -o output .cpp
```
Here, `filename.cpp` is the name of your C++ source code file.

4. If you want to link multiple files, separate them with spaces:
```
g++ -o output filename1.cpp filename2.cpp filename3.cpp
```

**Running**

1. Once compiled, you can run the executable file using its name followed by the `./` prefix:
